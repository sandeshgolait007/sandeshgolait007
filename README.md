## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sandesh Golait and I will tell you a secret: I am a computer science enthusiast.

Not only that my number three interest is music (Number one is sleeping off course ðŸ˜…)

I often find myself sitting with my guitar and keyboard.

But if we talk about my computer science passion, well that is something i can't stop talking about. I want to BUILD!! I want to create something that people will use and get benefitted from.

I am still learning, I will always learn, and I will apply myself.
